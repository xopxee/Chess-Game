Welcome to our Chess Game! This is our final project for the Object Oriented Programming class.
In the assignment that was given to us, we needed to challenge ourselves and test our programming skills and
teamwork skills to a nice output. We decided to go with a Chess game as it is something that was very familiar
to us from the beginning and we thought would be nice to try and make a computer game out of it in Java with the skills
we had learned with the discipline. As you can see we used a lot of OOP specific concepts to build this
and hope you can try and have fun with it.
